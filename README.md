# OpenFiling Test

## Requirements:

The project has been realised with Node.js, Express, Typescript and Mongodb.
Before running the project be sure you have Node and MongoDB installed.
(Other frameworks and libraries should should self-install with the application)

## How to install the project:

First you will need to install the project.
Go to the main folder and run `npm intall`
This should be enogh to setup the project

## Hot to run the project

The project has three command:
`npm run build` allows you to simply build the project. You can find the builded con in the `.dist` folder
`npm run start` runs the built project from the dist folder. This is to run the final build
`npm run dev` runs a local enviroment with hot-reload. This is the command to have the project running while developing.

Once you have the build running you can operate with the application in 2 way:

- Making API calls directly from the browser (more complex)
- Downloading and installing Postman and making API call from there (strongly recommended)
